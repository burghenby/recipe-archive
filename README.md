# recipe-archive
This is a project with the goal of archiving antique, vintage, and retro cook books, container recipes, packaged recipes, and old grocery store shelf recipes in such a way that that will be made accessible in a ledgible way in a variety of formats:

- The original layout and wording of the cook book and recipes within
- Attempting to update each cook book to modern equivalents of ingredients, measuring, and cooking methods as well as formatting to be a bit more uniform in some cases
- Compiling all recipes into a single cook book where updated recipes are alongside their original counterpart
