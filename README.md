# Recipe Archive Project
This is a project with the goal of archiving and preserving antique, vintage, and retro cook books as well as recipes that were/are included on food packages, product manuals, and grocery store shelves in such a way that that will be made accessible and legible in a variety of formats:

- The original layout and wording of the cook book and recipes within
- Attempting to update each cook book to modern equivalents of ingredients, measuring, and cooking methods as well as formatting to be a bit more uniform in some cases
- Compiling all recipes into a single cook book where updated recipes are alongside their original counterpart for posterity and comparison

This idea was inspired by the Internet Archive's goal of preservation and accessibility of media while I tried to figure out a way to condense my own bloated collection of cook books and recipes in a way that would be easier to navigate.\
In the process of doing so, I came to realize that I had so many recipes that I had once desired to use but had lost in the expanse of my growing collection. At the same time, I realized that I had lost some recipes over the years and had no realistic way of finding them again.\
This fact hit closer to home with my late grandmother's worsening dementia and learning that my father and his sisters were in the process of having to go through her estate. It wasn't realistic to ask for her cook books, knowing it would require shipping and the cost of that, but I hope that this project can, in some small part, contribute toward someone's future.
