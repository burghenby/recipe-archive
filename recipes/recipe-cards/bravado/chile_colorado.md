  (Note: Bravado Spice has "[Chile Colorado](https://bravadospice.com/blogs/recipes/chile-colorado)" in their recipe section on their website. It is different from the recipe card below and utilizes their Garlic & Arbol Moruga Scorpion Hot Sauce in place of their Crimson Seasoning.)

**Note**: Bravado Spice Crimson Hot Sauce is no longer listed. The closest equivalent based on Crimson's sauce ingredients seems to be their [Árbol Chili & Garlic Hot Sauce](https://bravadospice.com/products/arbol-chili-garlic-hot-sauce). The current listing for "Chile Colorado" on Bravado Spice's website uses their [Garlic & Arbol Moruga Scorpion Hot Sauce](https://bravadospice.com/products/garlic-arbol-moruga-scorpion-hot-sauce?_pos=1&_sid=6468613d6&_ss=r&variant=40785867604026) instead and seems to adjust their recipe accordingly.\
