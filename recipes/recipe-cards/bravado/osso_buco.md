2. In a large sauce pan or dutch oven, heat the oil to medium high heat and then add the butter. As soon as it melts, add the shanks and set aside.
3. Add chopped onions, carrots, and celery to the pot with rest of the butter and the rest of the salt and pepper and cook until the onions are translucent. THen add the garlic & tomato paste.
