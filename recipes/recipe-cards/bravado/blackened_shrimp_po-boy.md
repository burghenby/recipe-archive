# Blackened Shrimp Po'Boy

- **Source**: *[Bravado Spice](https://bravadospice.com/)* Blackened Shrimp Po'Boy recipe card
  (Note: Bravado Spice has "[Shrimp Po'Boy](https://bravadospice.com/blogs/recipes/shrimp-po-boy)" in their recipe section on their website. It is different from the recipe card below and utilizes their Árbol Chili & Garlic Seasoning in place of their Crimson Seasoning.)
---
**Total Time**: 15 min\
**Makes**: 4 servings

## Ingredients

- 3 T. Bravado Spice Crimson Seasoning (see note below)
- 1 oz. Bravado Spice Crimson Spice Sauce (see note below)
- 1 lb. raw shrimp, peeled
- 1/2 c. Mayonnaise
- 2 ft. Baguette, cut in fourths

- Pickles

**Note**: Bravado Spice Crimson Hot Sauce and Seasoning are no longer listed. The closest equivalent based on Crimson's sauce ingredients seems to be their [Árbol Chili & Garlic Hot Sauce](https://bravadospice.com/products/arbol-chili-garlic-hot-sauce). Additionally, the [Árbol Chili & Garlic Seasoning](https://bravadospice.com/products/garlic-arbol-seasoning) is used in the "Shrimp Po'Boy" recipe on the Bravado Spice website, seeming to indicate it as the Crimson seasoning replacement.\
**_Crimson Hot Sauce_**: White Vinegar, Red Jalapeños, Arbol Chilies, Garlic, Sea Salt, Sugar ([Source](https://crafthotsauce.com/products/bravado-spice-co-crimson-hot-sauce))\
**_Árbol Chili & Garlic Hot Sauce_**: Distilled Vinegar, Jalapeño Pepper Puree, Chile De Arbol Pepper, Garlic, Lime Juice, Cumin, Black Pepper, Salt

## Directions

1. Mix Bravado Spice Crimson Hot Sauce and mayonnaise. Set aside.
2. Dry the shrimp of any residual water or ice, lay them out and lightly brush with a little melted butter or oil and then dust the shrimp in the Bravado Spice Crimson Seasoning.
3. Over a very hot, un-oiled, preferably cast iron skillet, place the shrimp directly on the skillet until the seasoning begins to blacken; about 2 minutes. Flip and repeat, and remove from the skillet.
4. Cut the baguettes lengthwise, and fill with shrimp, lettuce, tomato, pickles, and a smear of the spicy mayonnaise.
5. Serve immediately.
