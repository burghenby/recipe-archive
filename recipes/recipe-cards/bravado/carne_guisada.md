## Directions

1. Heat the water till almost boiling and then steep the ancho chilies in it until softened. At least 10 minutes. Do NOT throw out the water.
2. Add chilies, 1/4 c. onion, a pinch of salt & pepper, and 1/2 of the chili water to a blender and blend until a thin paste.
3. In a bowl, mix the beef, flour, and one tablespoon each of salt & pepper until the meat is well coated.
4. In a large skillet, heat the oil to medium-high heat and sear the beef in the skillet until lightly browned. Add onion & garlic, and the remaining salt & pepper. When the garlic begins to brown, add the tomato sauce, chili paste, half the beef broth, and Bravado Spice Crimson Hot Sauce. Reduce heat.
5. Let the beef simmer uncovered in the chili gravy for four hours, adding the remaining beef brother in the sauce starts to get too thick.
6. Serve with warm tortillas, and onion & garlic as an optional garnish.
