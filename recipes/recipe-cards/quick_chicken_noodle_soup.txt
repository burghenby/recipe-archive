**Makes**: 6 servings

## Ingredients

- 2 cups water
- 1 (32-ounce) carton fat-free, lower-sodium chicken broth
- 1 Tbsp. olive oil
- 1/2 cup prechopped onion
- 1/2 cup prechopped celery
- 1/2 tsp. salt
- 1/2 tsp. freshly ground black pepper
- 1 medium carrot, chopped
- 6 ounces fusilli (short twisted spaghetti)
- 2-1/2 cups shredded skinless, boneless rotisserie chicken breast
- 2 Tbsp. chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley

## Directions

1. Combine 2 cups water and chicken broth in a microwave-safe dish, and microwave at HIGH 5 minutes.
2. While broth mixture heats, heat a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add oil to pan; swirl to coat. Add onion, celery, salt, pepper, and carrot; saut√© 3 minutes or until almost tender, stirring frequently. Add hot broth mixture and pasta; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer 7 minutes or until pasta is almost al dente. Stir in chicken; cook 1 minute or until thoroughly heated. Stir in parsley (serving size: about 1 cup soup).

**Tip**
Though we like the shape of fusilli for this soup, you can also make it with other pasta, such as wide egg noodles or even rice-shaped orzo.
