Flaky and golden, these biscuits have pleased diners since pioneer days. They are quick and easy to make and so much better than those in a can. You can make and shape them ahead; bake and serve hot from the oven.

**Prep Time**: 15 min.\
**Baking Time**: 12 to 15 min.\
**Makes**: About 20 biscuits

## Ingredients

- 2 c. All-purpose flour
- 1 c. Whole wheat flour
- 4-1/2 tsp. Baking powder
- 2 T. Sugar
- 1/2 tsp. Salt
- 3/4 tsp. Cream of tarter
- 3/4 c. Butter or margarine
- 1 Egg, beaten
- 1 c. Milk

**Tips:** To lower fat content, use skim milk. To lower salt content, eliminate the salt.

## Directions

1. In a bowl combine the flours, baking powder, sugar, salt, and cream of tartar.
2. Cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse cornmeal.
3. Add egg and milk, stirring quickly and briefly. Knead lightly on floured board.
4. Roll or pat gently to 1-inch thickness. Cut into 1- to 2-inch biscuits. Place in a greased 10-inch iron skillet or on a 9-inch square pan. For crusty biscuits, separate on a cookie sheet.
5. Bake at 450°F for 12 to 15 min.

**Good served with:** Crisp bacon and eggs in place of toast for breakfast. They are also tasty, split, spread with mustard and thinly sliced cold turkey and cheese.
