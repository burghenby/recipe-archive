# Cupcakes and Muffins

## Basics
Only fill cups halfway to prevent overgrowth during baking.

## Jumbo Size

For *cupcakes*, bake at 350F for approx. 25 minutes. For *muffins*, bake at 375F for approx. 25-35. As with any baked good, a clean toothpick or skewed inserted and removed is a good test of doneness, though added fruit or chocolates dispersed in the batter can give a false reading.

## Mini Size

For *cupcakes*, bake at 350F for approx. for anywhere from 8-15 minutes, possibly less depending on size. For *muffins*, bake at 400F for 10-17, though size may cause this to be less. Check for doneness, being aware of fruit or chocolates that can give false readings.
