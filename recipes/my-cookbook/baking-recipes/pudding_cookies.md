# Pudding Cookies

**Source**: Inspired by a recipe originally found on Pinterest with further research into other cookie recipes using instant pudding.
---

## Ingredients
#### Basic

- 3/4 cup Butter, softened
- 1/4 cup Granulated Sugar
- 3/4 cup Brown Sugar
- 2 Eggs
- 1 tsp. Vanilla Extract
- 2-1/4 cups Flour
- 1 tsp. Baking Soda
- 1-2 cups your choice of add-ins
- 1-3.4 oz (small) pkg. your choice Instant Pudding (See note if using 3 oz. Cook-&-Serve Pudding instead)

I have not yet tried Sugar-free Instant Pudding with this recipe. It's on my to-do list. See Issue #42
See [Combination Table]() below Directions

## Directions

Preheat oven to 350°F. Prepare baking sheets either by lightly coating with cooking spray or lining with parchment paper.\
\
In large bowl, cream butter and both sugars. Add dry pudding mix and beat until well combined. Add eggs and vanilla until well mixed, then add flour and baking soda until well combined.\
\
Stir in add-ins until evenly distributed. Scoop cookie dough and roll into 1-inch balls. Place on prepared baking sheets and bake for 8-10 minutes.\
**NOTE**: If using Cook-&-Serve Pudding instead of Instant Pudding, add 5 minutes to baking time.\
