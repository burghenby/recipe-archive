# Cookies from Cake Mix

**Source**: I'd seen the boxed cake mix method around many places; I don't believe I took this information from any one blog, video, or post. Converting a cake recipe, on the other hand, I have no recollection at all where I got the info I used and if memory serves, it was a miracle that the conversion even worked.

## Ingredients

- Cake Recipe or boxed cake mix
- 2 Eggs
- 1/2 c. Oil

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350°F.
2. BOXED CAKE MIX: To the boxed cake mix, add 2 eggs and 1/2 c. oil. Adjust the amount of eggs and oil as necessary per size of cake mix in order to achieve a cookie dough that can be rolled into 1-inch balls.
3. Place rolled cookie dough balls on parchment-lined baking sheets. Bake for 8-12 minutes. Allow to cool on baking sheet for 2 minutes before moving to a wire rack to cool completely.
4. CAKE RECIPE: Check out this article at Eathealthy365.com, "[The Foolproof Method for Turning Any Cake Recipe into Cookies](https://eathealthy365.com/the-foolproof-method-for-turning-any-cake-recipe-into-cookies/)." This article breaks down the core ingredients of most cake recipes, what needs to be adjusted from cake to cookie, and even offers some mistakes made and how they were corrected.
5. How I have done so in the past... and by "done in the past" I mean, like, once and I consider it a miracle it worked because I don't even know where I got the info that I ended up using, hence why I'm sharing the link above:
- [recipe flour] * 1.5 = [cookie flour]
- [recipe fat] = [cookie shortening] (If given the choice, I prefer shortening in a cookie)
- [recipe sugar] * 0.5 = [cookie sugar] (I may also just substitute granulated sugar entirely with brown sugar, I know I've done so in regular baking recipes)
- [recipe eggs] * 0.5 = [cookie eggs] (rounded down)
- [recipe soda/powder] * 0.5 = [cookie soda/powder] though per link above if I had removed any acidic liquid I should have added 1/4 to 1/2 tsp. soda 
- [recipe liquid] = just enough [cookie liquid] to let it stick together
- [recipe misc] = [cookie misc] (add-ins, seasonings, etc.)
