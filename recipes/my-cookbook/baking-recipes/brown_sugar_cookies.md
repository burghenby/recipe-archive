# Brown Sugar Cookies

- **Source**: _Crisco_ All-Vegetable Shortening package holiday wrapper. This is the recipe that I utilize as part of my "Chunky Chocolate Cookies" in place of a packaged sugar cookie mix.

## Ingredients

- 2 c. Flour
- 1/2 tsp. Baking soda
- 1/4 tsp. Salt
- 1-1/4 c. Brown sugar, firmly packed
- 1/2 c. Shortening
- 1/2 c. Butter
- 1 tsp. Vanilla
- 1 Large egg

## Directions

Preheat oven to 350°F. Beat egg, brown sugar, butter, shortening, and vanilla in a large bowl until creamy. In a separate bowl, combine flour, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add to creamy mixture, beating on low until just blended.\

Shape dough into 1-in. balls. Place on parchment-lined baking sheet, evenly spaced apart. Bake 12-14 minutes or until centers are just cooked. Cool on pan for 2 min. before moving to wire rack to cool completely.
