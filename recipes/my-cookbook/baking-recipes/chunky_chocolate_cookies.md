# Chunky Chocolate Cookies

**Source**: Believe the original recipe this came from was on a grocery store recipe card, but regardless of where the original recipe came from the recipe as it is now was adjusted a few times to suit my preferred baking and tastes.

## Ingredients

- 2 c. Flour
- 1/2 tsp. Baking soda
- 1/4 tsp. Salt
- 1-1/4 c. Brown sugar, firmly packed
- 1/2 c. Shortening
- 1/2 c. Butter
- 1 tsp. Vanilla
- 1 Large egg
- 1 c. Semi-sweet chocolate chunks
- 1/2 c. Mini chocolate chips
- 3 T. Cocoa powder (baking)

## Directions

Preheat oven to 350°F. Beat egg, brown sugar, butter, shortening, and vanilla in a large bowl until creamy. In a separate bowl, combine flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add to creamy mixture, beating on low until just blended. Stir in chocolate chunks and chips until evenly distributed.\

Shape dough into 1-in. balls. Place on parchment-lined baking sheet, evenly spaced apart. Bake 12-14 minutes or until centers are just cooked. Cool on pan for 2 min. before moving to wire rack to cool completely.

## Substitute

The purpose of the chunks and mini chips is for a variation of texture, but you can also use your choice of chocolate chips/chunks/morsels up to a total of 1-1/2 cups.

## Alternate

This recipe can be used to make butterscotch chip, white chocolate chip, or other morsel/chip/chunk variation cookies. Simply omit the cocoa powder (if desired) and substitute the chocolate chunks/morsels with your choice of chips/morsels/chunks.
