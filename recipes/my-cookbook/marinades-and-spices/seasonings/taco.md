# Taco Seasoning
---
## Ingredients

- 5 Tbsp. chili powder (not chili seasoning)
- 3 Tbsp. ground cumin
- 2 Tbsp. garlic powder
- 1 Tbsp. onion powder
- 1 Tbsp. paprika
- 1 Tbsp. salt
- 2 tsp. dried oregano
- 1 3/4 tsp. black pepper
- 1 1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper

## Uses

I primarily use this for seasoning the meat used in homemade tacos and fajitas. I have also used this to season rice for tacos when not using preseasoned rice as well as adding onto seasoning from prepackaged meals to give them some extra kick.

## Notes

Because tolerance to spice varies, feel free to adjust the amount of cayenne pepper to suit your personal tastes.

My recipe calls for ordinary *chili powder*, however, you can also utilize other varieties of chili powder, such as *dark chili powder*, *ancho chili powder*, or any combination of chili powders equalling a total of **5 Tablespoonfuls.**
- *(Note: Be sure that you only use chili powders, not chili seasoning. These are two different things and will affect the end result.)
