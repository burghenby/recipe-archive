# Pork Seasoning
---
## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup brown sugar
- 1 Tbsp. salt
- 1 Tbsp. cumin
- 1 Tbsp. garlic powder
- 1 Tbsp. chili powder
- 1 Tbsp. ground black pepper
- 1 Tbsp. paprika (I prefer sweet paprika)
- 2 tsp. ground dry mustard

## Uses

A bit more like a rub than a general seasoning, this works best if applied thick before letting the pork roast slow or sit on the grill for a long time on low heat. The brown sugar helps it make a very nice, sweet crust that is balanced by the seasonings.

## Notes

Because of the brown sugar, I like to store this in a short bail-type jar with a wide mouth. I reuse ones that used to store honey. The latch close and rubber ring help ensure that the sugar inside will remain airtight for longer.
