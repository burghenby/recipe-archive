# Chili Spice Mix
---
## ingredients

- 3 Tbsp. chili powder
- 2 tsp. Cumin
- 1 1/2 tsp. garlic powder
- 1 1/2 tsp. paprika
- 1 tsp. smoked paprika
- 1 tsp. oregano
- 1 tsp. unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1/2 tsp. onion powder
- 1/2 tsp. salt
- 1/4 tsp. thyme
- 1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper powder

## Uses
This is used exclusively when I make both my stovetop and crockpot chili as well as my all-meat chili spread. I also use it in any recipe that calls for chili seasoning (not specific chili powder) and in any boxed meal that already has chili seasoning but just needs some help.
