# Imitation McCormick Bell Pepper Salsa Seasoning
---
## Ingredients

- 1 Tbsp. onion powder
- 1 Tbsp. chili powder
- 1 Tbsp. Flat Iron Bell Pepper
- 2 tsp. paprika
- 1 tsp. salt
- 1 tsp. garlic powder
- TBA dried tomato

## Notes

I loved this bell pepper salsa breakfast seasoning from McMormick but the breakfast seasoning line has been discontinued for years. I still had the wrapper and tried to recreate it as best I could from the ingredients on the back and my memory of it. It's still a work in progress as I am missing a dried tomato element.

## Uses

This stuff was amazing on scrambled eggs. My imitation is still pretty good on eggs, though it's missing that dried tomato element.
