# Italian Herb

## Ingredients

- 2 Tbsp. dried basil
- 1 1/2 Tbsp. dried thyme
- 1 Tbsp. dried oregano
- 1 Tbsp. dried rosemary
- 1/2 Tbsp. garlic powder
- 1/2 Tbsp. dried parsley
- 3/4 tsp. onion powder
- 3/4 tsp. ground sage
- 1/2 tsp. ground marjoram

I use this to season tomato sauces, both with and without meat. I also use this for any recipe that calls for italian herb seasoning and to add extra seasoning to any boxed meals that already have italian seasoning.
