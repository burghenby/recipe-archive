# Curry Spice Blend
---
## Ingredients

- 2 Tbsp. cumin
- 2 Tbsp. ground coriander
- 2 Tbsp. tumeric
- 1-1/2 tsp. cardamom
- 1/2 tsp. cinnamon
- 1/2 tsp. cayenne

## Uses

I use this for any dish that called for a curry blend as I do not have either the access to the necessary fresh spices or the energy to spend on the process necessary to do things more authentically. This spice blend has allowed me to prepare meals to a flavor that resembles those I've had at restaurants close enough to satisfy me at home.
