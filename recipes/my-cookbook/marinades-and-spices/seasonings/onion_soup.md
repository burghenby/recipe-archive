# Onion Soup
---
## Ingredients

- 3 Tbsp. minced onion
- 4 tsp. bouillon (flavor is personal choice)
- 1 tsp. onion powder
- 1/2 tsp. paprika
- 1/2 tsp celery seed (I add more because I like celery seed)
- 1/8 tsp. ground black pepper (more or less to taste)

## Uses

Though I've only used this once, when was to add to a packet of broth when I was sick and the idea of eating was abhorent, I can fully see using this as a soup base/soup starter, to boost premade soups, or use it as a seasoning over a roast.
