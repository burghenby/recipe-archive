# Imitation McCormick Garden Herb Seasoning
---
## Ingredients

- 1-1/2 Tbsp. paprika
- 1 Tbsp. oregano
- 1/2 Tbsp. thyme
- 1 tsp. garlic powder
- 1 tsp. onion powder
- 1/2 tsp. salt
- TBA dried tomato

## Notes

I loved this garden herb breakfast seasoning from McMormick but the breakfast seasoning line has been discontinued for years. I still had the wrapper and tried to recreate it as best I could from the ingredients on the back and my memory of it. It's still a work in progress as I am missing a dried tomato element.

## Uses

This was amazing on scrambled eggs and in my tuna salad. It is the reason I ended up looking for alternatives to add to my tuna salad. My imitation is still good, but it is still leaving something to be desired without the dried tomato element.
