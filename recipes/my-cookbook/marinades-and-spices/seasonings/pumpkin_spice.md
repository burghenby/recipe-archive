# Pumpkin Spice
---
## Ingredients

- 8 Tbsp. ground cinnamon
- 1 1/2 Tbsp. ground ginger
- 1 1/2 Tbsp. ground nutmeg
- 1 Tbsp. ground allspice
- 2 1/2 tsp ground cloves

## Uses

This blend works well in many places, including batters *(pancakes, cookies, cakes, etc.)*, breads *(taking care to not add too much less you upset the balance)*, and coffee grounds *(again, taking care not to add to much as the finer spices do not play nice with paper filters)*.

I especially like to use this whenever a recipe calls for “pumpkin spice mix” or some other similar wording. I also tend to use this in place of a recipe's blend of spices by adding up the total amount of spice called for in the recipe and using that amount of this blend. It's easier for me than measuring out individual amounts of several different spices, and it gives me the comfort of knowing that the flavor will have some familiarity. I do so knowing that there is the risk of altering the final flavor from the original intended by the recipe, of course.
