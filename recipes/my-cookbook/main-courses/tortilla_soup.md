---
*Serves 4*

## Ingredients

- 1 bunch of scallions, sliced thin
- 1 Tbsp. olive oil
- 4 cups chicken broth
- 2 cups chicken, shredded (a good way to use up leftovers; roast or pan-sear for extra flavor)
- 1/4 - 1/2 tsp cayenne
- 2 roma tomato, diced (alternatively, 1 can diced or stewed tomatoes, undrained)
- tortilla chips, optionally slightly broken

## Directions

Cook the sliced scallions in olive oil until softened. Add remaining ingredients except for tortilla chips. Bring to a gentle boil and simmer for 20 to 30 minutes. Crumple tortilla chips into individual bowls when ready to serve.
