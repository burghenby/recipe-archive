---
*Serves 4*

## Ingredients

- 1 yellow onion, diced
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 Tbsp. olive oil
- 6 cups chicken broth
- 1 chicken breast, cooked as desired and diced (excellent use of leftovers)
- 1/2 tsp. dried thyme
- 1/2 cup carrots, diced
- 1/2 cup celery, diced
- 1 cup cooked orzo

## Directions

Cook the diced onion and minced garlic in olive oil until softened and aromatic. Add remaining ingredients except orzo. Bring to a gentle boil and simmer for 20 to 30 minutes.
