## Pale Gravy
- Color with a few drops of [Kitchen Bouquet](https://www.hiddenvalleykitchens.com/products/kitchen-bouquet/browning-seasoning-sauce/) (available at grocery store).
- To prevent the problem in the first place, brown the flour well before adding liquid. This also prevents lumpy gravy.
- A different way of browning flour is to put some flour into a custard cup and place beside meat in the oven. Once the meat is done the flour will be nice and brown, ready to make a rich, brown gray.

## Thin Gravy
- Mix water and flour or cornstarch into a smooth paste. Add gradually, stirring constantly, and bring to a boil.
- Try instant potato flakes instead of flour.

## Greasy Gravy
- Add small amount of baking soda if it is quite greasy.
- See Removing the Excess Fat, Kitchen Hints. [Note: This was a section in the original cookbook.]

## Too Salty
- For soup and stew, cut raw potatoes and discard once they have cooked and absorbed the salt.
- Another remedy for salty soup and stew is to add a teaspoon each of cider vinegar and sugar.
- Or, simply add sugar.

## Too Sweet
- Add salt.
- If it's a main dish or vegetable, add a teaspoon of cider vinegar.

## Gravy--smooth as silk
- Keep a jar with a mixture of equal parts of flour and cornstarch. Put 3 to 4 tablespoons of this mixture in another jar and add some water. Shake, and in a few minutes you will have some paste for gravy.
