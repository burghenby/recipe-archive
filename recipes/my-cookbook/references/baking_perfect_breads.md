## Rules for Use of Leavening Agents
1. To 1 tsp. soda use 2-1/4 tsp. cream of tartar, or 2 c. freshly soured milk, or 1 c. molasses.
2. In simple flour mixtures, use 2 tsp. baking powder to leaven 1 c. flour. Reduce this amount 1/2 tsp. for each egg used.
3. To substitute soda and an acid for baking powder, divide the amount of baking powder by 4. Take that as your measure of and add the acid according to rule 1 above.

## Proportions for Batters and Dough
Pour Batter .............. To 1 c. liquid use 1 c. flour

## Hints for Baking
Kneading the dough for half a minute after mixing improves the texture of baking powder biscuits.

Use cooking or salad oil in waffles and hot cakes in place of shortening. No extra pan or bowl to melt the shortening and no waiting.

When bread is baking, a small dish of water in the oven will help to keep the crust from getting hard.

Dip the spoon in hot water to measure shortening, butter, etc., the fat will slip out more easily.

Small amounts of leftover corn can be added to pancake batter for variety.

To make bread crumbs, use fine cutter of the food grinder and tie a large paper bag over the spout to prevent flying crumbs.

When you are doing any sort of baking, you get better results if you remember to preheat your cookie sheet, muffin tins or cake pans.
