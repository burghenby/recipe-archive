## Ingredients

- 1 pint Heavy Cream

## Directions

Pour entire pint of heavy cream into mixer. With whisk attachment, whisk at highest speed (without cream splashing) until it separates into butter and buttermilk.\
\
Turn down speed once you hear more splashing than mixing and watch until there is as much butter as possible in the whisk. Remove butter from whisk into cheese cloth or a clean tea towel and squeeze out as much buttermilk as possible.\
\
Rinse the butter with cold water. Place in a new cloth and squeeze again to remove all water.\
\
If desired, add a touch of salt to butter before storing.
