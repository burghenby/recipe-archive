# Appetizer & Beverage Hints
[This reference page originates from a cook book compilation sold as a fundraiser when I was in softball in middle school. This was located on the back of a chapter divider.]
---

- Try 1/2 cup plain yogurt, 2 packages low-cal sweetener, and 2 tablespoons of vanilla mixed together for a cereal topping, a decorative dessert topping or an appetite appeaser. It is also a good source of calcium.
- For a quick, low calorie dip, blend one 12-ounce carton of cottage cheese, 2 tablespoons of lemon juice, and a desired amount of [Good Season's Italian dry seasoning](https://www.kraftheinz.com/good-seasons/products/00043000979402-italian-dressing-recipe-seasoning-mix). Mix in a blender until smooth and refrigerate until ready to use.
- Use pretzel sticks instead of toothpicks when serving cubes of cheese. Stick one pretzel stick into your favorite cheese cube for added flavor and ease of handling.
- For a crispy, novel sandwich, prepare sandwich with a filling that's not too moise. Lightly butter the outside of both side of the sandwich and bake in your waffle iron.
- Nuts will come out of the shall in halves if soaked overnight in salt water before cracking. After cracking black walnuts, let stand overnight and they can be removed from the shell more easily.
- Keep unpopped popcorn in the freezer to help eliminate the unpopped kernels.
- Sprinkle popcorn lightly with warm water and let stand a few hours before popping. The added moisture makes it pop better.
- Slip plastic bags onto your hands when shaping popcorn balls. They won't stick to your hands or burn them.
- Rub a little butter over cheese that isn't to be used right away and it won't harden.
- Spread a cored apple ring with cream cheese or peanut butter. Top with a second cored apple ring.
- Dip ends of carrot, celery or cucumber sticks into softened cream cheese. Sprinkle with minced parsley.
- Combine 3 ounces cream cheese, softened, and 2-1/2 ounces deviled ham. Blend well. Use to stuff bite-sized pieces of celery.
- Tomato tempter: Combine 3/4 cup cold milk, 1/2 cup tomato-vegetable cocktail juice, 1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce, and salt to taste. Blend well. Makes 1 serving.
- Flavored milk drink: Shake together 1/2 cup cold milk and 1/2 cup orange, prune or apple juice. Pour into chilled glass. Makes 1 serving. Flavored milk also can be made with 1/2 cup unsweetened pineapple or grape juice and 1/2 cup cold milk.
- For easy reference, tape the measurements and directions to the lids of containers of coffee, tea or rice.
- For hot beverages, use freshly drawn cold water and boil as little as possible.
- Make your own Swiss Mocha drink by sing 1 teaspoon instant coffee and 1 teaspoon hot cocoa mix. It's delicious.
