## Time and Temperature Conversion
---
# Glass Dishes

Reduce baking temperature by 25 degrees and check for doneness at least 5 minutes earlier.

# Deeper Dishes

Decrease baking temperature slightly (about 25 degrees) and increase baking time by 1/4.

# Shallower Dishes

Increase baking time slightly (about 25 degrees) and degrees baking time by 1/4.

# For Convection Oven

Generally -25 F

Example: 375F conventional oven = 350F convection oven

# For Recipes without Oven Temperatures
Check your cook book's appendicies/reference sections for any thing specific to oven temperatures. Depending on the age and edition of the book, it may have its own reference to draw from that differs from other sources. A example of this is to compare the Purity Flour Cookbook between editions. The 1917 edition has no references to temperatures due to its age. The 1932 edition, as something a bit more modern, lists a temperature chart beneath its table of equivalent measures. However, the 1975 edition is absent this as more-or-less of a 1:1 reprint of the 1917 edition.
