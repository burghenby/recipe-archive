|  1 cup  |  1/4 cup  |  1 tsp.  |   2/3 cup    |   3/4 cup   |    1 cup    |
| 1 Tbsp. | 3/4 Tbsp. | 1/8 tsp. |  3/4 Tbsp.   |  3/4 Tbsp.  |   1 Tbsp.   |
| 1 tsp.  | 3/4 tsp.  | a pinch  |   3/4 tsp.   |  3/4 tsp.   |   1 tsp.    |

2 Tbsp. Sugar = 1/2 tsp. Vanilla

## Notes
#### Honey
Decrease liquid in recipe by 2-4 Tbsp., add a pinch of baking soda, and lower oven temperature by 25 degrees F.

#### Agave Nectar
Decrease liquid in recipe by 1/4 cup, increase cook time by 6%, and lower oven temperature by 25 degrees F.

#### Maple Syrup
Decrease liquid in recipe by 3 Tbsp., add 1/4 tsp. baking soda per cup of syrup added, and lower oven temperature by 25 degrees F.

#### Stevia
As there is disparity in volume between how much stevia is used versus sugar, some bulk will need to be replaced in the recipe. To replace this missing bulk, add applesauce, apple butter, or yogurt in the amount of sugar minus how much was replaced with stevia.
