## Directions - Updated



## Directions - Original

Mix two or three cooked yolks with two tablespoonfuls of butter, add four anchovies or the same amount of caviare or lobster, or even sardine paste, which comes in tiny cans and is convenient for the sandwich as well as the canapé. Soften this with lemon juice and spread on buttered toast, cover with whites of the eggs, minced fine, and put in the centre a tiny cucumber pickle curl. To make these cut a pickle in slices not quite through, leaving a strip, then put the ends together. It is a pretty garnish, if the gherkin is small enough.
