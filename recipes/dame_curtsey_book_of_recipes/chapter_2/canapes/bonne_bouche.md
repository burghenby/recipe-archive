## Directions - Original

Make some pastry cases by covering tiny but deep patty pans with rich pastry, and then cut very narrow strips of the pastry to make a rim for the cup. Bake them and when cool they will slip from the pans. When ready to serve, fill them with pâte de foie gras, made quite soft with whipped cream and seasoned with salt and cayenne or paprika. On top of each one put a tiny mould of aspic jelly. These are also suitable to serve with the salad course. The aspic is made out of clear veal or beef stock, stiffened slightly with gelatine and seasoned with a few drops of sherry and tarragon vinegar, or use cider vinegar and a bit of onion juice if without tarragon vinegar.
