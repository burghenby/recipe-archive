Toast oblong pieces of crustless bread, spread them with butter mixed with a very little French or German mustard, cover them with finely minced sour pickle, and then dust with grated hard-cooked egg yolk and dispose upon each a boneless herring, the imported variety, which are not expensive, and flank each side of the herring with strips of cooked egg white cut from end to end of the egg.
