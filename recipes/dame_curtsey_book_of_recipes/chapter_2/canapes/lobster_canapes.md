## Directions - Original

A sightly and delicious canapé is one covered with a lobster mixture. Shape the bread with a fluted cutter and toast it. Chop one cupful of lobster meat, season with salt, paprika, and lemon juice. Then moisten with a thick white sauce. Spread this mixture, rounding it slightly like a meringue on the bread, cover with creamed butter into which a small portion of white of egg has been worked, sprinkle with grated cheese, and brown delicately in the oven. The meat of crabs or shrimps may be used, if preferred, instead of lobster.
