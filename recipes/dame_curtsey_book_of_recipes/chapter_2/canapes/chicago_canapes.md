# Chicago Canapes

## Ingredients

- Bread
- Tomato, sliced 1/2-inch thick
- Hardboiled egg, separated
**Mixture**
- Caviare
- Lemon juice
- Cayenne
- Tiny flower, chervil, or parsley for garnish
**Alternative Mixture**
- Anchovy
- Pickled cucumber, chopped
- Beets
- Olives - See issue [#32](https://github.com/burghenby/recipe-archive/issues/32)

## Directions - Updated

1. Separate the egg white and egg yolk of the hardboiled egg. Chop the egg white very finely and set aside. In a bowl, mix the egg yolk with the caviar, lemon juice, and cayenne until well-mixed. Set aside. **Alternative:** If caviar is inconvenient, this mixture can be substituted as follows: Into the egg yolk, mix anchovy, chopped pickled cucumber, beets, and olives until well-mixed.
2. Slice tomato into 1/2-inch thick slices. Carefully scoop out the soft part of the tomato slices where the seeds reside. Take care to preserve the firmer branches surrounding these cells. Set aside.
3. Make round slices of toast. This can be accomplished either by cutting the bread slices into rounds first with a large enough cutter and then toasting in a flat pan or on flat top, or toasting first in a toasteror on a pan and then cutting into rounds with a cutter. Butter toasted rounds while still hot.
4. Lay a tomato slice on top of a buttered round. Into the scooped-out cavities, spoon enough of the egg yolk mixture to fill. Pile a small mound of egg white into a mound in the center of the tomato slice. Stick a tiny, edible flower into this mound. **Alternative:** If desired, substitute the edible flower for a sprig of chervil or parsley.**

## Directions - Original

Make round slices of toast, butter them and, while hot, lay on each a slice of tomato one-half an inch thick. But before putting the tomato on the toast, scoop out carefully all the soft part, leaving a cavity between each connecting section. Into this cavity put a mixture of caviare, cooked egg yolk, lemon juice, and cayenne. Chop the egg white very fine, pile it in a mound in centre of tomato, and in the centre of the mound put a tiny flower. If caviare is not convenient, anchovy, chopped pickled cucumbers with beets and olives may be used, and a sprig of chervil or parsley may be used instead of the flower.
