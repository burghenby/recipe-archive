Slice off the stem end of the lemon and utilize it for a lid. The easiest method for emptying the shell is to press out the juice on a cup-shaped lemon squeezer. With part of this juice make a plain lemon jelly. Do not sweeten it too liberally and tint it with leaf-green coloring. Cut into small cubes and mix with stoned cherries, raspberries, or pineapple. Sprinkle with powdered sugar. Fill the lemon cup, bore two holes in the lid, stick in a couple of soda water straws for a suggestion of a handle, and set on a small plate with a doily underneath.
