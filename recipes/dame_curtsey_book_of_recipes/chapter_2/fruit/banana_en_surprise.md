Select perfect fruit, pale yellow without black spots and not too large. Prepare one for each guest. Cut the banana lengthwise, not separating the two pieces at the stem end, so that the top will lift like a lid. Remove the fruit and, with a potato scoop, make four perfectly round balls which will fill the banana skin again. Put these back in the skins and pour in as much lemon juice, sufficiently sweetened with sugar, as the skin will hold. Lay the lid back and place carefully on ice. When opened the banana looks like a mammoth yellow pea pod. Serve on lace doilies on a fancy plate, a banana being placed at each guest’s place before the company is seated. Eat with a spoon.
