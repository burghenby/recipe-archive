Allow one grapefruit for each four or five to be served. Cut the fruit into halves, crosswise, then cut around the pulp in each section and take it out in neat pieces; cut the pieces into halves, reserve all the juice. Put a teaspoonful of red bar-le-duc currants into each glass, the grapefruit with juice above and sprinkle lightly with powdered sugar. At discretion take, for six glasses, a teaspoonful each, of kirsch and curacoa and divide among the glasses. Let stand in a cool place until ready to serve, then finish each glass with a generous tablespoonful of orange, grapefruit, lemon or pineapple sherbet.
