Shred one pineapple very fine and mix it with the carpels of three grapefruit and with enough sugar syrup to suit the taste. It should not be very sweet, however. Scoop out the halves of the grapefruit, cut the edges in points, and fill with the fruit mixture. Decorate with stars of angelica, which is made soft enough to cut by soaking it in a lemon syrup. The grapefruit pulp should be left in as large pieces as possible, as it is easily cut with the teaspoon with which the mixture is eaten. If one desires, a green jelly may be used instead of the angelica. Green mint jelly may be cut with a potato ball cutter into tiny balls and placed on the fruit the last moment before serving. This should be eaten with a spoon.
