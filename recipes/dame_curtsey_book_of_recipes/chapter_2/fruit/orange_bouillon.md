Squeeze and strain sufficient orange juice to measure one quart. Put into a double boiler with one-half of a cupful of granulated sugar, cover and stir occasionally until the sugar is dissolved and the mixture scalded. Dissolve two tablespoonfuls of arrowroot with one-half of a cupful of cold water, add to the contents of the double boiler and stir constantly, until thickened and clear, then cover and cook for five minutes. Set away until chilled, then add two tablespoonfuls of curaçao cordial. Serve in glasses with cracked ice.
