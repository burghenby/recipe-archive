Select large thick-skinned oranges. Take a slice from each end, then cut cleanly in two and lift out each section of fruit. Remove pith with a sharp curved knife. Keep fruit and cups in ice chest till needed. Drain the juice from the orange section; to it add a small quantity of soaked gelatine and sugar enough to sweeten it, then pour into a square tin, where the jelly will not be more than half an inch thick, and set on the ice to mold. When ready to serve, sprinkle the orange sections with powdered sugar, add the jelly cut into half-inch cubes, and with this fill each shell, heaping it high in the center. You can serve any summer fruit in this style, making a jelly from the orange juice, as suggested, and adding to it, before you fill the shells, strawberries or red raspberries, sliced bananas or large cherries and a few orange sections. Sprinkle the fruit with powdered sugar, but handle carefully as the beauty of this dish, as well as its delicious flavor, depends on the fruit being kept perfectly whole with a transparent cube of jelly showing here and there.
