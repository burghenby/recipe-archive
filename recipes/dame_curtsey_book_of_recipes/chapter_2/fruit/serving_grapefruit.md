The bitterness of the grapefruit may be. entirely disguised by cutting the fruit in two and pouring into each half one tablespoonful of good rum and one teaspoonful of sugar; one half a grapefruit is served to each person. In place of rum, if desired, Rhine wine, Madeira, or sherry may be used, and sugar added to suit the taste. Grapefruit served with strawberries at luncheon or dinner, before soup, makes an agreeable appetizer. The fruit should be cut in two, the pulp removed, and the juice pressed out; to each gill of juice, half a gill of Rhine wine, sherry, or Madeira should be added, and one tablespoonful sugar. Fill the grapefruit with strawberries and pour in it the juice and wine.
