Cut four large oranges in two and lift out carefully with an orange spoon the sections of fruit. Free the inside of each orange shell from skin and prepare the following fruit salad. The pulp of the oranges, kept as whole as possible, two bananas cut in fine dice, three tablespoonfuls brandied cherries cut in halves, half a cupful of Malaga grapes, halved and seeded, four tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar; over these pour two tablespoonfuls of sherry and one teaspoonful of rum. Allow this to stand on the ice half an hour, then fill each half of the orange with fillip. Serve on green leaves arranged on small plates.
