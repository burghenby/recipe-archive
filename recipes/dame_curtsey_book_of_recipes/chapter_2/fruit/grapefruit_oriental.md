Take grapefruit, honey, claret, preserved ginger, allowing one-half a small grapefruit to each person. With a pair of sharp shears remove all the white membrane in the centre. Then remove the seeds and loosen each division of the fruit. When thus prepared pour over each half two tablespoonfuls of strained honey. Set on ice for three hours. When ready to serve fill the cavity in the centre with finely chopped ginger mixed with sherry.
