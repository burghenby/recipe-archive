Pare half a ripe pineapple and cut into half-inch slices. Then remove the core and cut the slices into dice. Peel three oranges carefully, separate the sections, and remove every bit of membrane and the thin skin. Divide each section into two or three pieces. Mix the two fruits lightly together and place in a glass dish or salad bowl. Sprinkle with sugar and place on ice for two or three hours. Then cover with a layer of finely shaved ice, and garnish with pitted cherries. Serve before the ice has time to melt.
