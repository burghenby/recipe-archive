Select fine lemons of uniform size with smooth skins. Wash clean and dry on a cloth; then cut a rather thick slice the small end of each, and carefully scoop out the pulp, Putting the latter through a lemon-squeezer. Dice ripe bananas and add to them two-thirds their measurement in lemon Juice. Sweeten to taste and add ice-water to make of the proper consistency. Serve the mixture in the lemon cups on a bed of crushed ice. On the top of each cup, heap a tablespoonful of pistachio ice and put a maraschino cherry in the centre of it.
