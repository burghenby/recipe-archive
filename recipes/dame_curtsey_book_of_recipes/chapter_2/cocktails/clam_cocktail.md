## Directions - Original

Wash the desired number of Little Neck clams in fresh cold water, scrubbing each with a small brush. Wipe them dry. Open, and cut the clams clear from their shells. Serve five or six in a cocktail glass or in tomato cups in the following sauce. Allow one tablespoon of lemon juice, a few grains of cayenne pepper or a drop or two of tabasco sauce to each person, with a teaspoon of tomato catsup. Omit the latter if clams are served in tomato cups and add a pinch of mustard to the lemon juice. Some people like a few chopped capers and a dash of onion juice added to this sauce. If tomatoes are used they should be uniform in size and firm. Peel and cut a slice from the stem end, carefully scoop out the inside, sprinkle with salt slightly, invert on a plate and chill them thoroughly. When ready to serve them, arrange each tomato in a double grapefruit glass, having both filled with finely cracked ice. Make a depression in inside glass of ice and nestle the tomato in this, dispose sprays of parsley about the tomato over the ice; the latter will prevent its wilting. Put the clams in the tomato cups and pour over the sauce. Garnish the top of each cocktail with pimolas. Serve with small cress sandwiches.
