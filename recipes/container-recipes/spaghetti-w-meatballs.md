## Ingredients - Meatballs

- 8 good-quality pork meatballs
- 1 kg. beef mince
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- 1/2 a large bunch chopped flat-leaf parsley
- 85 g. parmesan, grated, plus extra to serve
- 100 g. fresh breadcrumbs
- 2 eggs, beaten with a fork
- Olive oil, for roasting

## Ingredients - Sauce
- 3 T. olive oil
- 4 garlic cloves, crushed
- 4-400 g. cans chopped tomatoes
- 125 ml. red wine (optional)
- 3 T. caster sugar
- 1/2 a large bunch chopped flat-leaf parsley
- Few basil leaves (optional)

- Spaghetti, to serve (about 100 g. per portion)


## Directions

1. Make the meatballs. Split the skins of the sausages and squeeze out the meat into a large mixing bowl.
2. Add mince, eggs and lots of seasoning. Get your hands in and mix together really well - the more you squeeze and mash the mince, the more tender the meatballs will be.
3. Heat oven to 220C°/200C° fan/gas 7. Roll the mince mixture into about 50 golf-ball-sized meatballs. Set aside any meatballs for freezing, allowing about five for portion, then spread the rest out in a large roasting tin - the meatballs will brown better if spaced out a bit.
4. Drizzle with a little oil (about 1 tsp. per portion), shake to coat, then roast for 20-30 mins until browned.
5. Meanwhile, make the sauce. Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan. Add the garlic cloves and sizzle for 1 min.
6. Stir in the chopped tomatoes, red wine, if using, caster sugar, parsley and seasoning. Simmer for 15-20 mins until slightly thickened.
7. Stir in a few basil leaves, if using, spoon out any portions for freezing, then add the cooked meatballs to the pan to keep them warm while you cook the spaghetti in the wok for boiling added with salt water.
8. Spoon the sauce and meatballs over spaghetti, or stir them all together and serve with extra parmesan and a few basil leaves, if you like.
