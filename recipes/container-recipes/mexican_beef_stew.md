COAT the beef with flour. Heat oil in a large killet over medium-high heat. Add beef and cook about 5 minutes, stirring frequently, until beef is browned: set aside. Add the beans, carrots, onion, garlic and browned beef to the lined slow cooker. Gently stir in tomatoes, broth, chili
powder, cumin, salt, and pepper with a wooden or plastic spoon. 
COVER and cook 3 to 4 hours on HIGH OR 6 to 7 hours on LOW, until the beef is fork-tender.

SERVE stew directly from lined slow cooker. Top with avocado, cilantro, and/or crushed red pepper, if desired. Remove all food and cool slow cooker completely before removing liner from slow cooker. Do not lift or transport liner with food inside.
