## Ingredients

- 1-3/4 c. plain yogurt (whole-milk or low-fat)
- 2-1/2 T. minced ginger
- 1-1/2 T. minced garlic
- 1 T. crushed red chile flakes, or to taste
- 1-1/4 T. ground cumin
- 1-1/4 T. dried oregano
- 1 T. table salt
- 1/2 T. freshly ground black pepper
- 3 T. olive oil
- 1-1/2 lb. boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- Naan, pita, or flour tortilla, warmed
- Romaine or leafy lettuce (optional)
- 1-1/2 c. plain yogurt (preferably whole-milk)
- 1/2 T. ground cumin
- 3 T. chopped mint
- 1 T. table salt, or to taste

## Directions

1. In a large bowl, combine all ingredients. [Note: 1-3/4 c. yogurt, 2-1/2 T. ginger, 1-1/2 T. garlic, 1 T. red chile flakes, 1-1/4 T. cumin, 1-1/4 T. oregano, 1 T. salt, 1/2 T. black pepper, chicken] Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes and up to 12 hours.
2. Prepare the Tiborang frying pan along with olive oil on medium heat for grilling.
3. Grill the chicken over medium heat with covered lid until cooked through, 6 to 7 minutes per side, depending on the thickness. Let the chicken meat cool down after cook.
4. Transfer the cooked chicken to a cutting board and thinly slice. Arrange the chicken on a platter. Arrange naan, pita, or tortillas on another platter. Set out the mint-yogurt dressing. [Note: Directions for this seem to be #6, which seem to be an afterthought and lack explicit details as to which ingredients in similar fashion as to #1; Based on arrangement of ingredient list in original recipe, combine 1-1/2 c. yogurt, 1/2 T. cumin, 3 T. mint, 1 T. salt or to taste.]
5. Instruct everyone at the table to pile several slices of chicken in a tortilla or pita, add some lettuce if desires, spoon some dressing on top, roll into a wrap, and devour.
6. While the chicken is cooking, in a smallish bowl, combine all the ingredients. Cover and refrigerate.
