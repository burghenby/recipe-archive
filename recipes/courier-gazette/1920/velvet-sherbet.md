## Directions - Original

Take the juice of six lemons, and the grated peel of two, soaked in the juice one-half hour. Add one cupful of sugar to each lemon, or sugar to taste; three pints of rich milk and turn into the freezer. The mixture will curdle but freezing will make it smooth and velvety. Turn the freezer slowly at first.
