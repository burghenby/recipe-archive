When there is a little popped corn left, try this wholesome dessert:

Scald three cupfuls of milk and pour over two cupfuls of popped corn which has been pounded until fine and let stand one hour. Add three eggs slightly beaten, one-half cupful of brown sugar, one tablespoonful of salt and stir until well mixed. Turn into a well buttered baking dish and bake in a slow oven thirty-five minutes. Serve hot with thin cream or maple syrup.
